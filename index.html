    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p class="lead">
      If you're a student that has trouble managing your time effectively, you've come to the right place.
      With our site, we can help you properly schedule your time blocking properly with school and other work.
      Users can also make profiles to connect with and start effective scheduling for groups or companies as well.
      We are just starting out, but eventually we will have a calendar built in as well!

        <h3>Time Blocking</h3>
        <p class="lead">
            Users will be able to input their classes or work schedules and create a proper time block
            to manage their weeks. Having this will allow the users to manage all their daily work around
            their classes or other activities.

        <h3>Calendar Planning</h3>
        <p class="lead">
            Having a calendar implemented in our site will let users manage all their events. Using the inputs
            they put in from the time block scheduling, users can make sure they have everything down to date 
            and time to make sure everything gets done.
        </p>

        <h3>Groups</h3>
        <p class="lead">
            One more feature we want to add is the use of groups. Having users create groups 
            based around their workplace or school class will allow coworkers to schedule 
            work or events properly. Having a chat function as well will greatly improve 
            productivity with their collaboration.
